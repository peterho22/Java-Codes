# Java Basics

This repository contains small Java console applications created to practice
fundamental programming concepts such as user input, conditional logic, loops,
and arithmetic operations.

## Programs Included

### Grade Calculator
A Java program that calculates a student’s final course grade using weighted
averages for labs, assignments, midterm exams, and final exams.

**Grade Weights:**
- Labs: 10%
- Assignments: 40%
- Midterm Exam: 20%
- Final Exam: 30%

### Number Operations
A menu-driven Java program that allows users to perform various operations on a
number, including:
- Re-entering the number
- Finding the additive inverse
- Finding the reciprocal (when applicable)
- Squaring the number
- Cubing the number

The program uses loops and switch-case logic to repeatedly process user input
until the user chooses to exit.

## How to Run
